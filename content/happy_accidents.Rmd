Welcome to my Happy Little World. Let's build something together.

# My Favorite Painter

```{r setup, echo=TRUE}

library(knitr)
happy_accidents <- file.path(getwd() ,'bob-ross.jfif')
include_graphics(happy_accidents)

```

# My Favorite Year
```{r echo=TRUE}

last.year <- "I hate 2020"
this.year <- "things will be better in 2021!"

```

`r last.year` but I know that **`r this.year`**

# Let's Move On
Enough with this world - let's get to the OFM data!
