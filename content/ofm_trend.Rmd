The data summarized in this document is pulled directly from the Washington State Office of Financial Management (OFM). RCW 43.62.030 states that OFM shall annually determine the April 1 populations of all cities and towns of the state.  OFM population estimates for cities and towns are used in state program administration and in the allocation of selected state revenues (RCW 43.62.020).  Population estimates for counties are used to allocate revenues as specified in RCW 36.13.100 and RCW 43.62.030. The dataset used in the following summary can be downloaded [here](`r toString(ofm.url)`).

# Regional Population
The population of the PSRC region totaled more than **`r toString(first.year.pop.region)`** people in `r toString(first.year)`. By `r toString(last.year)`, the total population of the region had grown to more than **`r toString(round(last.year.pop.region, -2))`** people, an increase of **`r toString(format(round(last.year.pop.region - first.year.pop.region, -1), nsmall=0, big.mark=","))`** people over `r toString(last.year - first.year)` years. More than *`r toString(round(last.year.region.share*100, 0))`%* of the State of Washington called the Puget Sound Region home in `r toString(last.year)`.

```

## Incorporated Area Population 
In `r toString(first.year)`, approximately *`r toString(round(first.year.region.inc.share*100, 0))`%* of the regional population lived in our region's vibrant cities and towns. By `r toString(last.year)` the share of population in cities and towns had grown to *`r toString(round(last.year.region.inc.share*100, 0))`%*, accounting for more than **`r toString(format(round(last.year.pop.region.inc, -2), nsmall=0, big.mark=","))`** people living in the region's incorporated places.

```{r incorporated_plot, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}


```

## Cities by Size in `r toString(last.year)`

```{r cities_data, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}


```

There are `r toString(num.juris)` cities and towns in the PSRC region. The largest city in `r toString(last.year)` was `r biggest.city` with a population of approximately **`r toString(format(round(biggest.pop, -2), nsmall=0, big.mark=","))`** people. The smallest place in the region in `r toString(last.year)` was the Town of `r smallest.city` with around **`r toString(format(round(smallest.pop, -1), nsmall=0, big.mark=","))`** people.

# County Population {.tabset}
There are `r length(psrc_counties)` counties that make up the Puget Sound Region and they are **`r psrc_counties`** counties. The population distribution of the `r length(psrc_counties)` counties are shown below:<br><br>
