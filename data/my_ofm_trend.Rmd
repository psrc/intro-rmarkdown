RCW 43.62.030 states that OFM shall annually determine the April 1 populations of all cities and towns of the state.  OFM population estimates for cities and towns are used in state program administration and in the allocation of selected state revenues (RCW 43.62.020).  Population estimates for counties are used to allocate revenues as specified in RCW 36.13.100 and RCW 43.62.030.
